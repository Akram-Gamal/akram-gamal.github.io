		<h3>Why Hire Me?</h3>
		<p>I'll put it simply. You'll basically hand me a task and ease you're mind knowing that it's gonna be done accurately and in a timely manner and you'll be handing tasks to a very good communicator who seeks to clarify everything before initiating the work to avoid mistakes. Basically, you'll be avoiding all sorts of headaches and bad communication and finally getting your tasks done in the easiest way possible.</p>
